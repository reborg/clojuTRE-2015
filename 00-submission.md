Less known pearls from the Clojure standard library

Over the years I had fun saving pointers to interesting Clojure bits in my Clojure Weekly series. Interestingly, I keep stumbling upon little or less known functions from the Clojure standard library that make development easier or more efficient. In this talk we'll see a few and hopefully Iâ€™m going to surprise you.

Started professionally around 2000, I've got my Commodore C16 sometimes in 1986. I've done work/research for different industries, corporate and startups, Europe and USA. I moved between different languages and finally landed on Clojure. I currently work at the Mailonline in London.
